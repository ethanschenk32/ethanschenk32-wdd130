      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I’m Ethan Schenk, a computer programmer from BYU Idaho. Have you ever signed up for a gym and struggled to find the information you needed? Whether it's class schedules, amenities, hours, or pricing, navigating a gym's website can sometimes feel overwhelming.
        That’s where I come in. I specialize in creating user-friendly websites tailored for gyms, ensuring that all essential information is not only easy to find but also visually appealing. My objective is to enhance your members’ experience from the moment they visit your site, making it seamless for them to explore classes, check amenities, and understand pricing. 
        

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>For people who are between the ages of 18-50 who are looking for growth. For people willing to create a culture of no limits, and hard work to see the growth they deserve.</p>  <!-- change this -->
